Just more things to update on this project so stay tune here on the project. we could add different
more features that makes the project easily works and we had to add the esp32 in arduino to communicate
with the firebase to upload the data and send the the real-time data and receive switches from firebase
to Arduino. And we could add a multithreading to avoid using two Arduino instead gonna merge it to one 
Arduino Megaa
